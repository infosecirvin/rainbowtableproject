vc binaries:
Ensure you have the VC++ 2010 x86 Redistributables installed
https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=8328

Later builds may require the x86 or x64 VC++ 2012 edition of the above
https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=30679

mingw binaries have no external requirements.

Extract the binary archive to a directory and setup is complete.

If you wish to build from source you can either use VC++ or MSYS/mingw.  You will need both openssl and pthreads includes and libraries.

Ad-hoc binary builds are statically linked and have no external dependencies.

Source builds need:
1) g++
2) make
3) libc dev libs
	libc6-dev in Debian/Ubuntu
	glibc-headers in Centos, Fedora, and RHEL
4) openssl dev libs
	libssl-dev in Debian/Ubuntu
	libopenssl-devel in Suse > 1110
	openssl-devel in Centos, Fedora, Mandriva, OpenSUSE (older), SLE (older), RHEL
5) pthreads dev libs
	normally part of libc6-dev in Debian/Ubuntu

Runtime performance is best when built using gcc >= 4.4.x, with large
improvements in 4.5.x, larger in 4.6.x, and I have no benchmarked 4.7.x yet.

Linux users
Run make and you should be finished.
For better performance add -mtune=native to the OPTIMIZATION variable in the Makefile.

*bsd users
You must use gmake instead of make at the current time.

Mac OSX users
You will need Xcode fully installed and then just run make.
Some versions of g++ will allow -mtune=native as noted for better performance
for Linux users.  If you enable the option and it fails to build then just use the Makefile as shipped.

SunOS/Solaris/OpenSolaris users
You must use gmake.  If the system fails to find g++ then either edit CC in the
Makefile as needed or create a symlink in your PATH for g++.

Linux binary builds/packages
https://build.opensuse.org/package/show?package=rcracki&project=home%3Aquelrod is the head/trunk build and you may look for derived packages named similar to the release names.
