0.6.5.1 (25 Oct 2010, 15:50:10):

* rti2 support

* improve hash performance by moving off openssl to the local faster methods
* sha1 local implementation was *slower* than openssl for x86/x86_64

0.6.4 (05 Jul 2010, 03:12):
* add -m to allow users to limit memory usage - courtesy of uroskn
* fix memory code that made incorrect assumptions about the MemoryPool
* fix linux memory code - using only info.freeram is incorrect
* cleanup of the nested if/elif/else stuctures
* annotate x86 specific sections of code
* licensing review and GPLv2 compliance
* cleanup of unused items
* restructure Makefile
* cleanup memory leaks

0.6.3 (21 Oct 2009, 21:05):
* Fixed x86_64 linux compilation
* Fixed x86_64 linux segmentation fault
* Fixed 64bit support in md4 code
* Added support for: FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, and MacOSX

0.6.2 (2 Jul 2009, 13:37):
* Fixed linux support (tty stuff and now actually compiles)
* Fixed precalculation code

0.6.1 (14 May 2009, 22:12):
* bug fixed where the list of rainbow tables is doubled when you resume a session and you have default RT locations in your ini

0.6 (14 May 2009, 20:47):
* Finding .rti files recursively
* Fixed memory allocation bugs (also trying to save appropriate amount of memory for chainwalksets... these can become really large with the new tables)
* Real pause/resume function, you can resume a session with -r
* Session support, use -s session_name. Combine this with -r to resume a session other then the default
* Ini file support, store some default values such as rainbow table directories.
* Tab separated results (stdout)
* Support pause during cracking and 'skip' during unicode correction for Linux
* A readme / 'manual' !

0.5 (16 Apr 2009, 22:47):
* Support for the old non-indexed .rt format, it should work with both type of tables in one run... I didn't test this feature thoroughly
* Using some other pieces of code for algorithms
* Support for .lst files from Cain as input (patch from James Dickson) - use for example -c LMNT.lst
* Fixed some bugs
* Dunno anymore, left this version lying around for too long...

0.4 (oops, a second 0.4) (13 Dec 2008, 18:20):
* Improved file reading performance

0.4 (27 Nov 2008, 00:09):
* Source included
* Memory usage down to about 50% (tnx sc00bz for pointing out the inefficiency, tnx jci for helping with the code)
* Works under Linux! (using pthreads now instead of Windows threads)
* Speed up: implemented MD4 reference implementation, not using OpenSSL for NTLM anymore (tnx Bitweasil for supplying 98% of the code)
* Speed up: using OpenSSL a lot faster (tnx jci for pointing that out)
* Probably some more small things i forgot

0.3 (16 Nov 2008, 01:01):
* Improved command line argument parsing (order no longer matters)
* Option to write (temporary) output to a file, use -o pick_a_nice_filename.txt
* Option to pause, press 'P' to pause/unpause (Windows only)
* For pwdump searches: unicode correction is done when case correction fails

0.2 (28 Oct 2008, 01:42):
* False alarm checking now also multi threaded
* Search one level of subdirectories for rainbow table files

0.1 (27 Oct 2008, 00:14):
* Initial multithreaded version, using Windows threads.
* Using multiple threads for the pre-calculation part.
* Added a simple 'progress' message, so you can see how many hashes are being pre-calculated
